Config-user examples

This folder contains example files to enable your RailCore in various configurations.

You can take a file, rename it to "config-user.g" and place it in /sys 
Each config file has the bare minimum enabled to allow the RailCore to be operational, and many conservative values
will be inherited from the stock config.g
To unleash your railcores speed, size or other features, test, measure and uncomment the various lines. 
Read the Duet G-code documentation on any line you are unsure with.
